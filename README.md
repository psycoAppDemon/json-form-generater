# json-form-generater

# Challenge: 
To build a completely dynamic site, JSON is one stop solutions for all, but creating JSON for new
forms, pages with all the event handling, validations, UI is very repetitive and time consuming. I built a mini
C.M.S.
# Our take: 
Created a web app, where we can design UI by drag and drop by
adding fields of different types in the work space(Textfield, date, Radio buton, file upload etc), and seamlessly
add events, actions, validations, alignments to individual field. And in the end, export the generated JSON as
Blob.
